Project Summary: Breeze Code

The Breeze Code is a Code Editor is a Python desktop application built using Tkinter, designed to offer a lightweight and user-friendly code editing experience reminiscent of Notepad++.

Key Features:

Tabbed Interface: Manages multiple open files efficiently using a modern tabbed layout, powered by ttk.Notebook.
File Operations: Provides standard functionalities to create new tabs, open existing files, save files, and save files with a new name (Save As...).
Line Numbers: Displays dynamic line numbers alongside the text area, enhancing code navigation and readability.
Syntax Highlighting: Offers basic syntax highlighting for several popular programming and markup languages, including Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, making code easier to read and understand.
Intuitive UI: Features a dark theme with carefully chosen foreground and background colors for improved visual comfort during coding.
Basic Editing: Includes fundamental undo, redo, cut, copy, and paste functionalities.
Tab Key Handling: Configures the Tab key to insert four spaces instead of a tab character, promoting consistent code indentation.
Unsaved Changes Prompt: Intelligently prompts the user to save unsaved changes when closing individual tabs or exiting the application, preventing accidental data loss.

How it Works:

The editor dynamically creates and manages Text widgets within ttk.Frame containers for each tab. It synchronizes line numbers with the scroll position of the text area and applies syntax highlighting based on the detected file extension. Regular expressions are used to identify keywords, strings, comments, and other language-specific elements for highlighting.

This project aims to provide a functional and aesthetically pleasing basic code editor for developers.
